The [Service Broker for AWS](https://network.pivotal.io/products/p-aws-services) provides [Pivotal Cloud Foundry](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) users with the ability to create and manage Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources from the cf CLI.

The Service Broker for AWS is installed once and exposes the selected AWS services in the Marketplace. App developers can then create and manage a service instance by using the CF CLI commands (create service, bind service, unbind service and delete service). 

AWS Services currently supported include:

* [AWS RDS for PostgreSQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/)
* [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
* [AWS RDS for MySQL](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/mysql/)
